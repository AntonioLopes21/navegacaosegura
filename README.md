## ðŸ“‹ About the Project
NaveGuard is an educational platform designed to teach children about online safety, digital privacy, and responsible online behavior. It features interactive games, quizzes, and simulations to demonstrate the consequences of different online behaviors.
This repository contains the front-end for the *NaveGuard* platform, responsible for intuitive and dynamic screens where users can register, log in, and access graphs, cards, and dynamic maps. The back-end of the project, developed concurrently, can be accessed here: [NaveGuard - Back-end](https://github.com/navsegura/navegacaosegura-backend).

## ðŸš« Problem Statement
We live in an era where children and teenagers spend increasing amounts of time connected to the internetâ€”on social media, gaming platforms, or apps. While this digital environment offers countless learning and entertainment opportunities, it also exposes young users to risks such as cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and dangerous interactions with strangers.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
Our solution is a platform featuring a 2D game that teaches children safe online practices. Additionally, it provides guides for parents and guardians to help them educate children and tutorials on using parental control tools to monitor internet access.

## ðŸ“… Conclusion
The *NaveGuard* platform combines entertainment and education with a strong focus on interactive games. This gamified approach, along with resources for both parents and children, creates a unique experience that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The platform not only educates but also entertains, ensuring greater engagement with the content.
A significant improvement for future development would be implementing a real database to store information, replacing the currently mocked data. This would allow for greater scalability, security, and flexibility in managing data, as well as providing a more robust experience for platform users.
